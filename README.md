# hello-node-app

# This creates a basic node server using Node.js and Express frame work.
# To use this app, you need to make sure you have node.js and Node Packet Manager (npm) installed on your machine.
  - To download these aboce prerequisites, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and follow the download instructions for your System (Mac, Windows, Linux, etc)
# Once you confirm that Node and npm are installed on your machine, grab the code for this app by clicking the green code drop down box at the main repository page and downloading a zip of the files.
# Now that you have the files you can unzip them, put them in a location that you can find them (I will be using /Desktop), and then open your prefered command line tool (I will use Bash here).
  - With the command tool open in the directory that is home to the newly unzipped file, use the command: 
     > node Hello\ Node/test.js
# This will start all the processes for the app, as well as hosting the webpage that all the content will appear on. NOTE: You may have to allow the program to work on your computer by clicking allow on a security pop up box after running the above command. 
  - Open a web browser and navigate to [localhost:3000](localhost:3000), and there you will see the web app working in your browser.
